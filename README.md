Code for reading out and interacting with the various sensors and instruments on the UMass liquid xenon (LXe) detector hardware.

"Valve_Interface.py" creates a graphical user interface (GUI) for openening and closing the valves on the UMass LXe detector, referencing functions contained in "on_off.py"

"DAQ.py" is the GUI for reading out the array of sensors on the UMass LXe detector in live plots, and also for executing automated calibration source injection procedures.
